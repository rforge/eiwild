\description{
eiwild means \emph{\strong{E}cological \strong{I}nference
\strong{W}ith \strong{I}ndividual \strong{L}evel
\strong{D}ata}.

It enables to estimate the inner cells of an RxC-table with
aggregate data with a number of precincts and/or individual
level data for a few precincts.

The assumptions are based on \emph{Rosen et al's} (2001) on
the Multinomial-Dirichlet- Model and the \emph{Wakefield's}
(2004) paper on combining individual level data for
2x2-tables. In the master thesis of Thomas Schlesinger
(2013) he expanded the 2x2-case to the RxC-case and
implemented it in this package. Some of the functions are
based on the equivalent functions of the
\emph{eiPack}-package.

It is a hierarchical Bayesian model which uses
MCMC-Algorithms to calculate the estimations. Therefore it
has all the pros and cons of these methods.

The typical workflow consists of \enumerate{ \item
Formatting your data in the accepted way.  Loading
\code{\link[eiwild]{topleveldat}} and inspecting the
\code{data.frame}'s \code{aggr} and \code{indi} will give
you a general idea.  \item Running one or multiple times:
\enumerate{ \item function \code{\link[eiwild]{tuneVars}}
\item function \code{\link[eiwild]{indAggEi}} } \item
Analyzing results with \code{\link[eiwild]{plot.eiwild}},
\code{\link[eiwild]{comPlot}},
\code{\link[eiwild]{summary.eiwild}},
\code{\link[eiwild]{plotResult}} }
